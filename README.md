Erlang
======

Code practice as I learn to program with Erlang


-Note -- I have completed the Edx.org course CS50x (Harvard) Intro to Computer Science
This course uses C (with some PHP at the end) for lectures and problem sets.

I am re-coding / porting the problem sets into Erlang and adding them here

---------------Update 5/21 -------------
Added fizzbuzz.erl (checks if an argument is a multiple of 3 or 5)
added sums.erl. sum/1 function will sum all integers between 1 and the argument. sum/2 adds all integers 
between the arguments as long as the first is the smaller. For example sum(1,3) returns 6. sum (3,1) is an error.
